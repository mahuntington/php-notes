# Homework

Finish all labs from [today](../student_labs/) and [yesterday](../../day2/student_labs/)

## Stretch

Add an angular front end.  Just drop your files wherever and reference them normally.  For instance if you had `index.html` in the root of the project, you can get to it via http://localhost:8888/index.html  `app.js` would be `http://localhost:8888/app.js`.
